# Getting started with Network Programming

## Will learn the basics of networking, the relevant network protocol, and basic socket programming.

Networking encompasses concerns at many different abstraction levels. The concerns your
router has with forwarding network packets. Let's look at these models.

## OSI layer model
Protocols define everything from the voltage levels on an Ethernet cable to how 
a JPEG image is compressed on a web page. It's cleart that, when we talk about the voltage
on a Ethernet cable, we are at much different level of abstraction. For this reason, 
we breake the problem down into many smaller pieces. 
The most popular layer system is called the **Open Systems Interconnection**. It has seven layers:
